        <h1>How lead poisoning has continued to impact NY children statewide</h1>

        <p>When we think of the blood-lead crisis, our minds often return to Flint, Michigan, or Warren, Pennsylvania.</p>

        <p>The reality, however, is that New York state — more specifically its central counties — is facing historic levels of lead poisoning and has been for over two decades. Kelly Mikullitz, an Albany-based attorney fighting for low income children with dangerous blood-lead levels, said it is the least understood catastrophe the state faces.</p>

        <p>Since 2000, New York state has reported over 3,500 children with dangerously high blood-lead levels. Mikullitz said that while this number is already alarmingly high, many other cases do not end up in state records due to infrequent testing, inaccurate reporting, and poor access to healthcare professionals.</p>

        <p>“I’ve had cases where I've had clients where they're moving from one hazardous home to another hazardous home to another hazardous home,” Mikullitz said. “You can see the lead paint hazard findings at each place that they lived, it's unbelievable. They really cannot escape it.”

        <p>In New York, lead contamination often stems from one of two sources: lead paint and tap water contamination. Mikullitz said many of her poisoned clients are exposed from both sources.</p>

        <p>The most common way for kids to access lead is the paint in their own walls. As window sills and floor trim become old, paint tends to chip, Mikullitz said, often resulting in young children gnawing on pieces of dried, poisonous paint. And given the widespread nature of the issue, few statewide efforts have come close to garnering the influence or capital to systemically attack the crisis.</p>

        <p>Many central New York homes in lower income areas haven’t received new interior paint coats since the state <a href="https://weact.org/programs/lead-paint-right-to-know-act/">banned </a>lead paint use in homes in 1978. Mikullitz noted that while the ban disallows new homes’ contamination, the law puts no pressure on homeowners and landlords to make their buildings safer.</p> 

        <p>Lead poisoning can have severe and lasting effects on children, including developmental delays, learning difficulties, and behavioral problems, Mikullitz said. Even low levels of lead exposure can damage a child’s brain and nervous system, potentially leading to reduced IQ and attention span. As a result, there is a direct correlation between an individual’s level of lead poisoning and participation in criminal activity.</p>

        <p>Health experts <a href="https://weact.org/programs/lead-paint-right-to-know-act/">warn</a> that these impacts are often irreversible with some symptoms taking years or decades to manifest. Because of this, Mikullitz and her legal team have made early detection and prevention central to their efforts.</p> 

        <p>This issue expands beyond socio-economic divide to segregation and systemic racism, according to Mikullitz. The three most contaminated NY counties, including Oneida, Onondaga and Erie, all report the majority of their positive tests in historically marginalized black and brown communities, such as Syracuse’s 15th ward.</p>

        <p>“(Race and ethnicity) is a reason why the legislature hasn't done as much about it as they could,” Mikullitz said. “Because, quite candidly, look at how you know things like trampoline injuries are handled, you know. It’s not equitable."</p>

        <p>With lead impacting children for their lives and generations suffering directly, Mikullitz said her main priority when working with clients is to hold those responsible accountable.</p>

        <p>Under current legal standards, Mikullitz said landlords and their insurance often escape without losing any money because of <a href="https://www.dfs.ny.gov/insurance/ogco2003/rg030312.htm">“lead exclusion laws”</a> that exempt insurers from covering lead-related damages.</p>

       <p>These laws are under attack, however, as legislators in Albany continue to push for a bill that would hold landlords — and their insurance companies — accountable in cases where children test positive for lead while living in their buildings. Led by State Senator Sean Ryan, the coalition for this bill has expanded to 22 legislators, but hasn’t made it out of the state’s insurance committee meetings since first introduced in 2017, according to Mikullitz.</p>

        <p>Ryan was unavailable to provide comment.</p> 

        <p>“These families, they're poor, they're a minority, nobody's helping them,” Mikullitz said. “It's just crazy to me that the insurance companies, making money left and right are not, are not on the hook, but these little kids are.”</p>

          <p>While frustrated by legislative delays, Mikullitz said some regions in the state are seeing improvements, noting that if metropolises like New York city have <a href="https://www.nyc.gov/office-of-the-mayor/news/287-23/mayor-adams-new-yorkers-fight-against-lead-exposure-appoints-new-citywide-lead">improved significantly</a> , so can smaller municipalities.</p>

          <p>Ryan’s coalition is expected to work with Governor Kathy Hochul and other state officials to prioritize their legislation in the coming year.</p> 

          <p>“(Republicans) argue that the bill is going to directly affect the consumers and raise premiums, but what's the cost to society of the alternative?” Mikullitz said. “We're still providing all of the necessary education and assistance that they need as a result of being poisoned, so that comes at a cost. We're also sustaining the financial consequences and societal consequences of any of their criminal behavior as they get older.” </p>
